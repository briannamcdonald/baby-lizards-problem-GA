## Problem Description
In the N-Queens problem that is similar to the Baby Lizards Problem, you must place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. 

The Baby Lizards Problem is a twist on this where N lizards must be placed in an NxN grid-like nursery that also contains immovable trees in predefined positions. When two lizards are in the same row, column, or diagonal, the lizards can eat each other, **unless there is a tree between them**. The goal is to place the lizards such that no lizards can be eaten.

The presence of trees changes the solution drastically from the solution of the N-Queens problem, as many of the possible optimizations for the N-Queens problem no longer work in this case.
